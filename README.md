# LCS
For LCS homework

To use the program, copy + paste into your python interpreter.

Curretly there are 4 available options:

[1] Verify proposition | Makes sure the string input is a WFF

[2] Compute given interpretation | Will ask the user for an interpretation

[3] Compute table of all interpretations | Will generate a table with all the interpretation and will specify weather the proposition is valid, satisfiable or unsatisfiable.

[4] Compute logical equivalence | Will ask the user for 2 propositions and will verify if they are logically equivalent (Not completed)


#Table updated with Pandas library, fixed lazy operations.
#Fixed the Contradiction/Tautology issue. (Anihilation Laws)
#Fixed ordered atomic proposition in table

Known issues:
Reduction laws don't hold due to the difference in tables sizes and the use of the anihilation law module.
  


  Not all steps are included, if needed, I could add them hopefuly.
  
  
  The program only works for strong syntax.
  (To run the program, pandas library needs to be installed)
  Relaxed syntax is wip.
